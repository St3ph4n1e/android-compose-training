# Android Compose Training

This repository contains my training exercises and experiments with **Jetpack Compose**, the modern UI toolkit for Android development using **Kotlin**.

## 🧠 Objective

To learn and master Android UI development using:
- Jetpack Compose (declarative UI)
- Kotlin programming language
- Android Studio and modern Android architecture

## 🚀 Project Structure

- `app/` – Main application module
- `MainActivity.kt` – Entry point of the Compose UI
- `@Composable` functions – Reusable UI building blocks

## 📦 Technologies

- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- Material Design 3
- Android Studio Giraffe/Koala (or latest)
- Gradle (KTS or Groovy)

## 📌 What I’m practicing

- Basic UI components (`Text`, `Button`, `Column`, `Row`, etc.)
- State management with `remember`, `mutableStateOf`
- Themes and dark mode support
- Recomposition and performance
- Navigation and architecture (coming soon)

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/St3ph4n1e/android-compose-training.git
   ```
2. Open it in **Android Studio**
3. Run the app on an emulator or physical device

## 🌱 Work in Progress

This is a **learning repository** – code will evolve as I explore new features and patterns in Jetpack Compose.
